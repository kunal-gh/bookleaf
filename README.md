# BookLeaf Publishing — AI Support Automation Suite 📚

An intelligent, production-ready hybrid automation suite designed to streamline BookLeaf's author support queries across various communication channels (Email, WhatsApp, Instagram, Web) with a robust multi-signal identity resolution pipeline, confidence-based human handoff gates, and persistent audit trail logging.

---

## 1. Problem Statement
BookLeaf Publishing receives hundreds of daily queries from authors across Email, WhatsApp, and Instagram DMs regarding publishing timelines, royalties, add-on packages, author copies, and sales numbers. This system automates routine lookups by unifying disparate author communication profiles, classifying queries using LLMs, and retrieving accurate database and knowledge-base answers, while safely routing borderline or angry queries to human agents via an 80% confidence circuit breaker.

---

## 2. Architecture Diagram
The system employs a **hybrid architecture** that balances low-code/no-code operational flexibility (n8n Cloud) with granular code-level control for intelligence, fuzzy logic, and database operations (FastAPI and Supabase).

## 6. Confidence Logic
We use a weighted composite formula to prevent hallucinated support answers from reaching authors:

$$\text{Confidence Score} = 0.50 \times \text{Intent Confidence} + 0.30 \times \text{Effective Identity Confidence} + 0.20 \times \text{KB Relevance}$$

### Rules & Thresholds:
1. **Effective Identity Confidence:** For general FAQ questions (`query_type == "kb_query"`), identity is not required and is automatically set to `1.0` in the formula. For DB queries, it matches the actual resolved identity confidence.
2. **Floor Guarantee:** If `intent_confidence >= 0.90` AND `effective_identity >= 0.90` AND `kb_relevance < 0.3`, the score is floored at `0.82` (guaranteeing that high-confidence database lookups without knowledge-base matches do not get falsely escalated).
3. **The 80% Circuit Breaker:** If the final score is $< 0.80$, or if the intent is classified as `unknown` or `escalate_human`, or if any database exception flags are raised, the system immediately triggers a human handoff workflow.

## 7. Error Handling Summary
Defensive execution is baked into every layer of the codebase:

| Scenario | Detection Location | Fallback Behavior | User Message | Logged |
|----------|-------------------|-------------------|--------------|--------|
| **Supabase Unreachable** | `data_retriever.py` | Gracefully return DB error flag to FastAPI pipeline, triggering immediate escalation | "I'm unable to access your records right now. Connecting you to a human agent..." | Yes, with traceback |
| **No Author Match** | `main.py` | Sets `identity_conf = 0.0`. If a database query is requested, the score drops below 0.80, forcing a human handoff | "I want to make sure you get the most accurate help. I've escalated your query..." | Yes |
| **Multiple Books (No Title)** | `main.py` | Detects multiple books linked to the author, skips escalation, and returns an interactive disambiguation selection | "I found multiple books under your account: [titles]. Which one are you asking about?" | Yes |
| **OpenAI API Outage** | `main.py` | Standard try/except blocks catch all API timeouts/errors, falling back to instant human escalation | "I'm unable to answer that right now. Connecting you to a human agent..." | Yes, with error_info |
| **Borderline Confidence (<80%)** | `confidence_scorer.py` | Confidence scoring circuit breaker fires, overriding the drafted response | "I want to make sure you get the most accurate help. I've escalated your query..." | Yes, `escalated=True` |
| **Angry / Threatening Tone** | `intent_classifier.py` | GPT-4o-mini detects angry, complaining, or legal language and triggers the `escalate_human` intent | Handed off to human immediately regardless of other signals | Yes |

## 8. Identity Unification (Three-Tier Pipeline)
Authors connect with BookLeaf across email, phone, and social media handle. Our system unifies profiles dynamically in three tiers:

![Identity Flowchart](docs/identity_flowchart.png)

1. **Tier 1 — Auto Match ($\ge 80\%$ Base Score):** Instantly links the incoming query to the database profile.
   * **Weights:** Email exact (35 pts), Phone normalized exact (30 pts), Name fuzzy token sort ratio > 70 (25 pts), Instagram exact (10 pts).
2. **Tier 2 — Borderline Arbitration ($40-79\%$):** Triggers a secure GPT-4o-mini evaluation which compares full profiles and produces a match probability.
   * If prob $\ge 0.85$ $\rightarrow$ `auto_link`.
   * If prob $0.60 - 0.84$ $\rightarrow$ `verify_manually` (queues inside the administrative review table).
   * If prob $< 0.60$ $\rightarrow$ `create_new`.
3. **Tier 3 — Create New ($< 40\%$):** Safely provisions a new author profile to avoid mismatched records.

---

## 9. RAG Pipeline
For general, non-record policy questions (e.g., "How long does publishing take?"), the system uses an in-memory semantic RAG search:
1. **Document Chunking:** `knowledge_base/bookleaf_kb.md` is parsed and split dynamically at `##` markdown headers, ensuring complete context chunks.
2. **Vector Embeddings:** Chunks are pre-vectorized using `text-embedding-3-small` and saved in a cached local JSON file.
3. **Cosine Similarity:** Real-time user queries are embedded on-the-fly and matched against the cached embeddings using NumPy vector math. Chunks scoring above `0.50` relevance are passed to GPT-4o-mini as verified context for response drafting.

## 10. n8n Workflow Diagram
The n8n workflow canvas manages routing, escalation checks, and direct audit trail writing.

![n8n Workflow](docs/n8n_workflow.png)

*The raw workflow JSON is fully exported and available for import at [n8n_workflows/bookleaf_gateway.json](file:///c:/Users/kunal/OneDrive/Desktop/Book-tool/bookleaf-ai-automation/n8n_workflows/bookleaf_gateway.json).*

## 11. Test Cases
Eleven test scenarios are prepared to validate the entire matrix of operations and error scenarios. You can run them instantly using any REST Client (e.g., the VS Code REST Client plugin) with [tests/test_queries.http](file:///c:/Users/kunal/OneDrive/Desktop/Book-tool/bookleaf-ai-automation/tests/test_queries.http):

1. **Happy path — book live** (Sara Johnson gets direct book status)
2. **Royalty on_hold** (Rahul Das gets empathetic response directing him to support)
3. **Author copy not dispatched** (Priya Sharma gets details of her dispatched book copies)
4. **Add-on status** (Sara Johnson checks her Bestseller Package)
5. **KB-only query** (RAG semantic lookup for general policies without an email)
6. **ESCALATION — gibberish** (Triggering circuit breaker on unintelligible inputs)
7. **ESCALATION — angry legal threat** (Direct human handoff on hostile language)
8. **No match — unknown email** (Graceful fallback when email cannot be found)
9. **Multiple books** (Disambiguation lookup for Nisha Patel)
10. **Identity resolve Sara** (Validates 4-signal weighted identity calculation)
11. **Health check** (Verifies system status and database ping)

---

## 12. Future Improvements
1. **Database Vector Search (`pgvector`):** Transition the static RAG cache into Supabase's `pgvector` extension for scalable semantic retrieval of thousands of KB documents.
2. **Multi-Agent Orchestration (LangGraph):** Swap linear pipelines for a stateful multi-agent system where dedicated agents handle intent, data routing, and auditing independently.
3. **Real channel integration:** Replace ngrok webhooks with real Twilio (WhatsApp API) and Meta (Instagram Direct Message API) developer configurations for true omni-channel deployment.

## 14. Self-Rating Table

| Category | Rating (1-10) | Reasoning |
|----------|---------------|-----------|
| **Zapier / Make / n8n** | **7/10** | I understand visual canvas programming, webhook mapping, and conditional filters. For this suite, n8n orchestrates the channel layer, applies the 80% circuit breaker gate, and provides direct logging—highlighting clean division of labor. |
| **LangChain / OpenAI** | **8/10** | I use raw OpenAI APIs directly with structured output parameters (`response_format={"type": "json_object"}`) and embeddings. Avoiding bloated framework abstractions guarantees low latency, direct error handling, and reliability. |
| **System Design** | **8/10** | Designed with bulletproof reliability in mind. Separate backend services are completely decoupled, logging writes are fail-safe, and the confidence scorer operates as a hardware-like circuit breaker to prevent hallucinations from ever reaching users. |
